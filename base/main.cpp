// TinyDisp is an evolution of ALAMO model, written by prof. Roberto Sozzi.
// My contribution is, to clarify the code and its internal working in view
// of explaining what a conventional Lagrangian particle model is in its very essence.
//
// To a very large extent, the simple architecture of orignal ALAMO code
// has been retained.
