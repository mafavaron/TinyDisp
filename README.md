# TinyDisp
A lightweight particle atmospheric dispersion model.

# Core motivations
Extant Lagrangian particle models are complex pieces of software, and their use often demands large scale computing power. TinyDisp has been designed with a GRALsmall footprint in mind, and this makes the model ideal for testing and research.
