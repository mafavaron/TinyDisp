! TinyDisp - A very simple ultrasonic anemometer flow visualization
!            tool, showing (in 2D) effects of both long-range
! transport and turbulent diffusion.
!
! Data are assumed to be coming from a set of ultrasonic
! anemometer files stored in a dedicated form (for now).
!
! TinyPart follows the NanoPart idea, but with important
! simplifications aimed at improving speed, at the cost of
! a dramatic reduction of scientific capability.
!
! Let me say, this is something interesting didactically:
! no research purposes.
